	#stage_0 You're playing a game on your PC when you notice that the performance of the computer is significantly slower than normal. You:
		#stage_0.button1 Close the game immediately and investigate the problem.
		#stage_0.button2 Continue playing (it's your rank up game) and will close after the match is done.
		#stage_0.button3 Brush it off and keep playing

	#stage_1 You began on finding and fixing your computer problem by: (W)
		#stage_1.button1 (W) Searching the problem and how to fix it on Google 
		#stage_1.button2 (W) Update your CPU and GPU drivers, and Motherboard BIOS
		#stage_1.button3 (W) Examine your Task Manager, determine what files are affecting your processing speed
	
	#stage_2 Some time later... 
	
	#stage_3 The performance of your computer continues to decrease. What do you do now?(C)
		#stage_3.button1 (C) Still ignoring it. 
		#stage_3.button2 (C) Use Google to search what the problem might be and ways to fix it.
		#stage_3.button3 (C) Perform a factory reset on the computer. 
	
	#stage_4 You decided to do a factory reset on the computer. This means that every file you have saved on your computer will be erased if you don't save it in a storage device. What do you do?
		#stage_4.button1 Save all your important files on a USB before the factory reset.
		#stage_4.button2 Don't save anything and start the factory reset immediately. 

	#stage_5 Based on your search findings, you concluded that the type of malware that's infecting your computer could possibly be a computer worm due to the following reasons: (1) Your computer system is stationary. (2) You haven't clicked on any links that are sent to you from someone you don't know. (3) One of the characteristic of a computer worm is that it can automatically replicate and spread through an internet router. So it's either your other device were infected with the worm or someone else's device that used the same router as you got infected by the worm. There are also ways on how to remove the worm. What do you do? 
		#stage_5.button1 = Turn off your router, run a full security scan on your computer, and look at Task Manager.
		#stage_5.button2 = Perform a factory reset.

	#stage_6 As you look at the Task Manager you notice a file name MorroW. Something about this file seems fishy as it's using up a lot of your resources. What do you do?(T)
		#stage_6.button1 You Google the file name. It shows that the file doesn't belong to any credible company and is flagged as malicious. You then right-clicked and select end task, open the file location and delete all instances of the file on your computer.
		#stage_6.button2 You don't delete the file as you're afraid it might crashed your computer.

	#stage_7 Bad End 
		# After a while, your computer is completely unusable. Now your other devices and those who shared the same router as your computer began to experience problems. 
	
	#stage_8 Nuclear Ending (Bad)
		# You have successfully reset your computer, the worm is gone. However, all your data stored in your computer have been deleted and now you have to install everything again. 
	
	#stage_9 Nuclear Ending (Good)
		# You have successfully reset your computer, the worm is gone. All of your important data is saved and you began to install everything again.
	
	#stage_10 Good Ending 
		# Congratulations, your computer is completely rid of the malware and its performance is back to normal. Now you start to scan for viruses more regularly and are able to continue gaming in peace.
